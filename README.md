Sentiment Analyzer Project
Overview
This project is part of the NLP coursework and implements a sentiment analysis tool that classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral. It uses Python for the backend to process and analyze text data, and Streamlit for the frontend to provide an interactive user interface.
Features

Text Input: Users can input text through a web interface built with Streamlit.
Sentiment Classification: Analyzes the sentiment of the input text using NLP techniques.
Real-time Results: Displays sentiment results instantly with confidence scores.
User-Friendly Interface: Clean and intuitive design for easy interaction.

Technologies Used

Backend: Python, NLTK/VaderSentiment (or other NLP libraries like TextBlob, Hugging Face Transformers)
Frontend: Streamlit
Dependencies: Listed in requirements.txt

Usage

Open the Streamlit app in your browser (default: http://localhost:8501).
Enter text in the provided text box.
Click the "Analyze" button to view the sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) along with a confidence score.
Optionally, explore additional features like sentiment history or visualizations (if implemented).

How It Works

Backend: The sentiment_analyzer.py script processes input text using an NLP library (e.g., VADER or a pre-trained transformer model) to compute sentiment scores.
Frontend: The app.py script uses Streamlit to create a web interface for text input and result display.
Integration: The frontend communicates with the backend to send user input and retrieve sentiment analysis results.

Future Improvements

Add support for multiple languages.
Incorporate advanced models (e.g., BERT) for improved accuracy.
Include visualizations like sentiment trend graphs.
Add batch processing for analyzing multiple texts.
