# ðŸ“Š Sentiment Analyzer

This project is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) coursework and implements a sentiment analysis tool that classifies text as *Positive, **Negative, or **Neutral*. It leverages Python for backend processing and Streamlit to provide a sleek and interactive web interface.
